            Windows:
              - Download `Toyhouse.Extensions_x64_en-US.msi` or `Toyhouse.Extensions_x64-setup.exe`

            Linux:
              - Download `toyhouse-extensions__0.4.3__amd64.AppImage`, `toyhouse-extensions_0_0.4.3__amd64.deb` or `Toyhouse.Extensions_x64.app.tar.gz`

            > **Important**
            Ubuntu 22.04 switched from openssl1.1 to openssl3.0, and this causes Toyhouse Extensions to crash on distros with openssl@v3. To fix this issue, please see [this StackOverflow thread.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72133316/libssl-so-1-1-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-directory)

            MacOS:
              - Download `Toyhouse.Extensions__0.4.3__x64.dmg`
